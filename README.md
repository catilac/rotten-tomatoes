Assignment 1: Rotten Tomatoes

Time: Roughly 30 hours
Tasks: Everything is done, except for search
![Video Walkthrough](rotten-tomatoes-walkthrough.gif)

Install instructions:
1. Clone repository
2. Run `pod install`
3. Open `rotten-tomates.xcworkspace` (Do not open the xcodeproj!!)
4. Compile

Notes: I worked really hard on the requirements, but didn't think hard enough
about the UI. UIScrollView and other interface details require the most work.
Next time, I plan to focus on that before diving too far into optional requirements.
