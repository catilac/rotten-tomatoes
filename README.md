#Assignment 1: Rotten Tomatoes

Tasks: Everything is done, except for search

![Video Walkthrough](rotten-tomatoes-walkthrough.gif)

##Install instructions:
1. Clone repository
2. Run `pod install`
3. Open `rotten-tomates.xcworkspace` (Do not open the xcodeproj!!)
4. Compile

Notes: I worked really hard on the requirements, but didn't think hard enough

about the UI. UIScrollView and other interface details require the most work.

Next time, I plan to focus on that before diving too far into optional requirements.

Polish is a critical piece to iOS development. There is so much weight behind it that 
you could possibly take a "less is more" approach, and be very successful.
